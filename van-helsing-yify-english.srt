3
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,430
It's alive.

4
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:57,809
It's alive. it's alive!

5
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,702
There he is!
Hit it again!

6
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:26,754
Success!

7
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,424
Count, it's just you.

8
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:33,052
I was beginning to
lose faith, Victor.

9
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:39,017
A pity your moment of
triumph is being spoiled

10
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,603
over a little thing
like grave robbery.

11
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:43,104
Yes.

12
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:46,024
I must escape this place.

13
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:48,818
Where are you going
to run, Victor?

14
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:54,699
Your peculiar experiments
have made you unwelcome

15
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,201
in most of the civilized world.

16
00:01:57,327 --> 00:02:01,122
I'll take him away, far away,
where no one will ever find him.

17
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:02,999
No, Victor.

18
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:06,461
The time has come for me
to take command of him.

19
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,796
What are you saying?

20
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,758
Why do you think I brought you here?
Gave you this castle?

21
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,134
Equipped your laboratory?

22
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,552
You said...

23
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,138
You said you
believed in my work.

24
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,723
And I do.

25
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:23,645
But now that it is,
as you yourself have said,

26
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:27,273
a triumph of science

27
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,609
over God,

28
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:36,115
it must now serve my purpose.

29
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,329
What purpose?

30
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,259
Good God!

31
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,180
I would kill myself before
helping in such a task.

32
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:02,934
Feel free. I don't actually
need you anymore, Victor.

33
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,811
I just need him.

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,188
He is the key.

35
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:11,192
I could never allow him
to be used for such evil.

36
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:12,944
I could.

37
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:16,864
In fact, my brides
are insisting upon it.

38
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,537
Igor, help me!

39
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,665
You have been
so kind to me, Doctor,

40
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,459
caring, thoughtful.

41
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,170
But he pays me.

42
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,551
Stay back.

43
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:39,178
You can't kill me, Victor.

44
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,891
Ah!

45
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,478
I'm already dead.

46
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,870
Dr. Frankenstein!

47
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,875
Look, it's headed
for the windmill!

48
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,543
Come on!

49
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,756
Burn it!
Burn it down!

50
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,956
Why?

51
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,928
Why?

52
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,615
Vampires.

53
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:46,908
Run for your lives!

54
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,492
Vampires!

55
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:10,973
Father.

56
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,486
Evening.

57
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:32,698
You're a big one.
You'll be hard to digest.

58
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,327
I'd hate to be such a nuisance.

59
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,420
I missed you in London.

60
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:50,341
No, you bloody did
not! You got me good.

61
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,219
Dr. Jekyll, you're wanted by the
Knights of the Holy Order...

62
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,595
it's Mr. Hyde now.

63
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,431
...for the murder of
12 men, six women, four...

64
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:02,436
Children, three goats, and a
rather nasty massacre of poultry!

65
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,732
So you're
the great Van Helsing.

66
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:09,026
And you're
a deranged psychopath.

67
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,493
We all have our
little problems.

68
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,206
My superiors would like
for me to take you alive

69
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,875
so that they may extricate
your better half.

70
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,503
I bet they bloody would.

71
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,423
Personally, I'd rather just
kill you and call it a day.

72
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,051
But let's make it your
decision, shall we?

73
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,636
Do let's.

74
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:59,952
Here I come,

75
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,288
ready or not!

76
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,002
The bell!

77
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,949
No, no.

78
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,120
I'll bet that's upsetting.

79
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,383
Paris!

80
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,472
Come here.

81
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:08,520
I think you'll find the view
over here rather spectacular.

82
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,069
It's been
a pleasure knowing you.

83
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,612
Au revoir!

84
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,342
Oh, no.

85
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,018
My turn.

86
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,211
May he rest in peace.

87
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,063
Van Helsing.

88
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,233
You murderer!

89
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,928
Bless me, Father, for I have...

90
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,682
Sinned. Yes, I know.
You're very good at that.

91
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,726
You shattered the Rose Window.

92
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,562
Not to split hairs, sir, but Mr.
Hyde did the shattering.

93
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:17,274
13th century.
Over 600 years old.

94
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,361
I wish you a week
in hell for that.

95
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,196
It would be a nice reprieve.

96
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,699
Don't get me wrong.
Your results are unquestionable

97
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,952
but your methods attract
far too much attention.

98
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,122
"Wanted" posters?
We are not pleased.

99
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,375
Do you think I like being the
most wanted man in Europe?

100
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,169
Why don't you and the Order
do something about it?

101
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,421
Because we do not exist.

102
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,340
Well, then neither do I.

103
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:49,139
When we found you crawling up the
steps of this church, half-dead,

104
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,726
it was clear to all of us that you
had been sent to do God's work.

105
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,144
Why can't he do it himself?

106
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,479
Don't blaspheme.

107
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,191
You already lost your memory
as a penance for past sins.

108
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,735
If you wish to recover it

109
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,738
I suggest you continue
to heed the call.

110
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,243
Without us, the world
would be in darkness.

111
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:12,496
Governments and
empires come and go

112
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,167
but we have kept mankind
safe since time immemorial.

113
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,045
We are the last
defense against evil.

114
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,590
An evil that the rest of mankind
has no idea even exists.

115
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:28,262
To you, these monsters are just
evil beings to be vanquished.

116
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,932
I'm the one standing
there when they die

117
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,851
and become
the men they once were.

118
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,479
For you, my good son, this
is all a test of faith.

119
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:41,442
And now, we need
you to go to the East.

120
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,695
To the far side of Romania.

121
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,114
An accursed land

122
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,200
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures.

123
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,620
Lorded over by
a certain Count Dracula.

124
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,247
Dracula?

125
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,373
Yes.

126
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,418
You've never faced
one like this before.

127
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,797
Our story begins 450 years ago

128
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:07,634
when a Transylvanian knight,
named Valerious the Elder,

129
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:11,221
promised God that his family would
never rest nor enter heaven

130
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,349
until they vanquished
Dracula from their land.

131
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,852
They have not succeeded

132
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,980
and they are
running out of family.

133
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:25,194
His descendant Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

134
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,905
He disappeared
almost 12 months ago.

135
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:34,328
His only son, Prince Velkan, and
his daughter, Princess Anna.

136
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,956
If the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished,

137
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,794
nine generations of their family will
never enter the gates of St. Peter.

138
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,339
For more than four centuries

139
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,008
this family has
defended our left flank.

140
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,927
They gave their lives.

141
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,514
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

142
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,933
So you're sending me into hell.

143
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,561
In a manner.

144
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:06,276
Valerious the Elder left
this here 400 years ago.

145
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,695
We don't know its purpose

146
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,365
but he would not
have left it lightly.

147
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,076
The Latin inscription
translates as,

148
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:17,663
"In the name of God,
open this door."

149
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,290
There is an insignia.

150
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:27,005
Yes, it matches your ring.

151
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:32,177
I think that in Transylvania you
may find the answer you seek.

152
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,562
Faster, please.
Faster!

153
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,150
Getting there.

154
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,235
Carl!

155
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,361
There you are.

156
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,281
Did you bring Mr.
Hyde back, or did you kill him?

157
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,699
You killed him, didn't you?

158
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,409
That's why they get so annoyed.

159
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,910
When they ask you to
bring someone back,

160
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,745
they don't mean as a corpse.

161
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,414
All right, you're
in a mood. Come on.

162
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,250
I have some things that'll put
the bit back in your mouth.

163
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,460
Any idiot can make a sword.

164
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,462
Sorry, Father.

165
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,589
Come along, Carl.

166
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,424
Here, take this.

167
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:14,344
Rings of garlic, holy water,

168
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,725
silver stake, crucifix.

169
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,063
Why can't I have one of those?

170
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,608
You've never gone after
vampires before now, have you?

171
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,985
Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks,
they're all the same.

172
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,069
Best when cooked well.

173
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,446
No, they're not all the same.

174
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,489
A vampire is
nothing like a Warlock.

175
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,074
My granny could kill a Warlock.

176
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,243
Carl, you've never even
been out of the abbey.

177
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:39,745
How do you know about vampires?

178
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,496
I read.

179
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,874
Here's something new.

180
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,543
Glycerin 48.

181
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,842
Sorry!

182
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,303
What in the name of
Allah is wrong with you?

183
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,555
The air around here
is thick with envy.

184
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,516
This is my latest invention.

185
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,976
It's gas-propelled.

186
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,354
Capable of catapulting
arrows in rapid succession

187
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,897
at tremendous velocity.

188
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,066
Just pull
the trigger and hold on.

189
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,902
I've heard the stories
from Transylvania.

190
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,320
Trust me, you'll need this.

191
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,988
A work of certifiable genius.

192
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,406
If you don't say so yourself.

193
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,200
No, I did say so myself.

194
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm a veritable
cornucopia of talent.

195
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,745
Did you invent this?

196
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,664
I've been working
on that for 12 years.

197
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,582
It's compressed
magma from Mt. Vesuvius

198
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,709
with pure alkaline
from the Gobi Desert.

199
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:28,835
It's one of a kind.

200
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,253
What's it for?

201
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,673
I don't know, but I'm
sure it'll come in handy.

202
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,883
12 years, and you
don't know what it does?

203
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,678
I didn't say that.
I said I didn't know what it's for.

204
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,138
What it does is to
create a light source

205
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,848
equal to
the intensity of the sun.

206
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,517
This will come in handy how?

207
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,852
I don't know.
You can blind your enemies.

208
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,146
Charbroil a herd of
charging wildebeest.

209
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,690
Use your imagination.

210
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,274
No, I'm gonna use yours.

211
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,567
That's why
you're coming with me.

212
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,027
Holy hell be damned that I am!

213
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,112
You cursed.

214
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,240
Not very well, but you're a monk.
You shouldn't curse at all.

215
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,868
Actually, I'm still just a friar.
I can curse all I want,

216
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,161
damn it!

217
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,248
The Cardinal has ordered
you to keep me alive.

218
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,542
For as long as possible.

219
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,460
But I'm not a field man.

220
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,131
I don't want to
go to Transylvania.

221
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,673
Come on.

222
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:00,177
Dracula unleashed
you for a reason.

223
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,076
Pull me up!

224
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,536
It's stuck!

225
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,463
No, Anna, it will kill you!

226
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,089
That's my brother out there.

227
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:43,053
Cut the rope! Cut it now!

228
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,026
Velkan!

229
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,789
My gun! Find my gun!

230
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,165
Find Velkan's gun.

231
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,875
It has to be
the silver bullets.

232
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,631
Anna, hurry!

233
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,635
Move.

234
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,097
Anna, look out!

235
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,600
Run!

236
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,132
Velkan.

237
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,471
God

238
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,808
help us.

239
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,048
So, what do you remember?

240
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,716
Not now, Carl.

241
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,635
There must be something.

242
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,013
I remember fighting
the Romans at Masada.

243
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,640
That was in 73 A.D.

244
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,058
You asked.

245
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,479
What are we doing here?

246
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,898
Why is it so important to
kill this Dracula, anyway?

247
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,817
Because he's
the son of the Devil.

248
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,985
I mean, besides that.

249
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:48,405
If we kill him, anything bitten
or created by him will also die.

250
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,489
I mean, besides that.

251
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,367
Welcome to Transylvania.

252
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,547
Is it always like this?

253
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,923
Pretty much.

254
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,926
You, turn around.

255
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,932
Let me see your faces.
Why?

256
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,309
Because we don't
trust strangers.

257
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:20,687
Strangers don't last long here.

258
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,481
5'7" by 2'3"

259
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,777
Gentlemen, you will
now be disarmed.

260
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,238
You can try.

261
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:36,286
You refuse to obey our laws?

262
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,246
The laws of men
mean little to me.

263
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,206
Fine.

264
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,416
Kill them.

265
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:42,709
I'm here to help you.

266
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,377
I don't need any help.

267
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:45,670
Really?

268
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,481
Everybody inside!

269
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:06,649
Hide the children!

270
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,678
Stay here.

271
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,681
You stay here.
They're trying to kill me.

272
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,815
Marishka, kill the stranger.

273
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:48,066
Love to.

274
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:54,989
Run!

275
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,627
Carl, it's not working.

276
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,879
Try aiming at their hearts.

277
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,589
it's the sun.

278
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,485
Van Helsing.

279
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:03,493
Do you like to fly, Anna?

280
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,009
Hello, Anna.

281
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,349
Nice to see you, too, Aleera.

282
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:55,188
Did I do something
to you in a past life?

283
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,482
Don't play coy
with me, Princess.

284
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:04,489
I know what lurks
in your lusting heart.

285
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,283
I hope you have
a heart, Aleera,

286
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,411
because someday I'm going to
drive a stake through it.

287
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,299
This should do the trick.

288
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,010
Holy water!

289
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,478
Stop your teasing, Marishka,
and finish him.

290
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,943
Too bad. So sad.

291
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,986
The church!

292
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,834
Thirty years old.

293
00:31:58,251 --> 00:31:59,961
Perfectly aged.

294
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,839
Hello, Anna, my dear.

295
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,853
The last of the Valerious.

296
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:54,932
I can feel fresh blood
rushing through her veins.

297
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,102
Here she comes!

298
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,151
I want first bite.

299
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,357
He killed a bride!

300
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,775
He killed Marishka!

301
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,574
You killed Marishka!

302
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,617
You killed a vampire!

303
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,202
But isn't that a good thing?

304
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:41,205
Vampires only kill what
they need to survive.

305
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:43,332
One or two people a month.

306
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,877
Now they will kill for revenge.

307
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,341
Are you always this popular?

308
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:53,801
Pretty much.

309
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:58,306
So what name, my good sir, do
I carve on your gravestone?

310
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:00,474
His name is Van Helsing.

311
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,442
Your reputation precedes you.

312
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:17,825
Next time stay close.
You're no good to me dead.

313
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:19,994
Well, I'll say this for you.

314
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,579
You've got courage.

315
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,583
He's the first one to kill
a vampire in over 100 years.

316
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,419
I'd say that's
earned him a drink.

317
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,718
Marishka!

318
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,438
Why can't they
just leave us alone?

319
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:51,817
We never kill more than our
fill and less than our share.

320
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,819
Can they say the same?

321
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:59,950
Did I not stress how important it was
to be finished with Anna Valerious

322
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:03,704
before she destroys what
we are trying to create?

323
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,206
We lost Marishka.

324
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,832
Master.

325
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:10,544
There, there, my darlings.
Do not worry.

326
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,630
I shall find another bride.

327
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:14,006
What?

328
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:17,009
Do we mean so little to you?

329
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,178
Have you no heart?

330
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:23,599
No, I have no heart!
I feel no love!

331
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,768
Nor fear,

332
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,396
nor joy,

333
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:31,232
nor sorrow!

334
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,695
I am hollow.

335
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:42,785
And I will live forever.

336
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,412
My Lord.

337
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:46,580
It is not so bad.

338
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:55,548
I am at war with the world
and every living soul in it.

339
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:59,218
But soon the final
battle will begin.

340
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:02,138
I must go and find out
who our new visitor is.

341
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:10,146
You will have to make a
little apéritif out of him.

342
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:13,733
We are much too close to
success to be interrupted now.

343
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:14,984
NO!

344
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,528
The last
experiment was a failure!

345
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:21,657
Please, say you
will not try again.

346
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:26,245
My heart could not bear
the sorrow if we fail again.

347
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:37,673
Come.

348
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:41,635
Do not fear me.

349
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,888
Everybody else fears me.

350
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:46,891
Not my brides.

351
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,104
Igor.

352
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:55,191
Yes, Master.

353
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,527
Why do you
torment that thing so?

354
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:00,821
It's what I do.

355
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,616
Remember, Igor,
"Do unto others..."

356
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:07,995
Before they do unto me, Master.

357
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:11,165
Now go, all of you!

358
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:14,043
To Castle Frankenstein!

359
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:19,089
Yes, we will try again.

360
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,386
So, how did you get here?

361
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,679
We came by sea.

362
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:26,764
Really? The sea?

363
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:27,807
Well, yes.

364
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,183
The Adriatic Sea?

365
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:30,976
So, where do I find Dracula?

366
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,063
He used to live in this
very house four centuries ago.

367
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,106
No one knows
where he lives now.

368
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,275
Father would stare at
that painting for hours

369
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:40,027
looking for Dracula's lair.

370
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,821
So that's why you've come?

371
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,322
I can help you.

372
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:44,865
No one can help me.

373
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,116
I can try.

374
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,203
You can die trying.
All of my family has.

375
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:50,788
I can handle this myself.

376
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,164
So I noticed.

377
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:53,791
The vampires
attacked in daylight.

378
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:54,875
They never do that.

379
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,336
I was unprepared.
It won't happen again.

380
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,171
So why did they
attack in daylight?

381
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,549
Clearly they wanted
to catch me off guard.

382
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,926
They seem almost desperate
to finish off my family.

383
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,845
Why is that? Why now?

384
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,471
You ask a lot of questions.

385
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:08,931
Usually I ask only two.

386
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,850
What are we dealing with?
How do I kill it?

387
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,268
My father spent
most of his life

388
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,144
looking for
answers year after year.

389
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,731
Tearing through the tower, combing
through the family archives.

390
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,066
Carl, the tower. Start there.

391
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,192
Right.

392
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:23,696
The only way to save your family is
to stay alive till Dracula's killed.

393
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,865
And who will
kill him if not me?

394
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,366
Who will show
courage if not me?

395
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,952
Go alone and you'll be
outmanned and outpositioned.

396
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,871
And you can't see in the dark.

397
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,456
In the morning,
we will hunt him

398
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:37,293
but we'll do it together.

399
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:46,176
Some say you're a murderer,
Mr. Van Helsing.

400
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:50,472
Others say you're a holy man.
Which is it?

401
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:56,145
It's a bit of both, I think.

402
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,233
I promised you a drink.

403
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,818
Yes, you did.

404
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,905
The bar is down the hall.
Help yourself.

405
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:09,366
As for me, I'm going to
finish this once and for all.

406
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,244
I'm sorry you have to
carry this burden alone.

407
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,538
On the contrary, I would
wish for it no other way.

408
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,373
I'm sorry about your
father and brother.

409
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:18,083
I will see them again.

410
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,878
We Transylvanians always look
on the brighter side of death.

411
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:22,588
There's a brighter
side of death?

412
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:25,507
Yes. It's just harder to see.

413
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,266
I'm sorry about that, too.

414
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:48,864
Van Helsing!

415
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:01,377
Van Helsing?

416
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:29,024
Velkan?
Anna.

417
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,944
Oh, my God, you're alive.

418
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,906
No. Anna,
I only have a moment.

419
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,741
But there's a werewolf...
Never mind! Listen to me!

420
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:40,285
I know Dracula's secret.
He has a...

421
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,876
Velkan?
Please.

422
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:50,879
No!

423
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:20,075
Run, Anna.

424
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:39,761
Anna!

425
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,644
Are you all right?

426
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:05,746
Why does it smell
like wet dog in here?

427
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:07,039
Werewolf!

428
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:09,124
Right. You'll be needing
silver bullets, then.

429
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,584
Well done.

430
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:01,134
Who's hunting whom?

431
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:13,522
Nice night.
This is a bit tight for me.

432
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:17,693
But for you it's a perfect fit.

433
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:20,904
What a coincidence.

434
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:24,074
I see the wolf man
hasn't killed you yet.

435
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,993
Don't worry,
he's getting to it.

436
00:46:26,076 --> 00:46:27,452
You don't seem
too bothered by him.

437
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:29,121
I'm no threat to him.

438
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:32,124
I'm just the one who
cleans up after him,

439
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:34,126
if you get my meaning.

440
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,295
Little late to be digging
graves, isn't it?

441
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:38,630
Never too late to dig graves.

442
00:46:40,257 --> 00:46:43,719
You never know when
you'll need a fresh one.

443
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:50,559
Oh, sorry.
It's just my nature.

444
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:04,406
NO.

445
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:09,619
- Move!
- NO!

446
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:15,250
Why?

447
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:16,877
You're choking me!

448
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,920
Give me a reason not to.

449
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:22,007
I can't. If people knew...

450
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,596
He's not your
brother anymore, Anna!

451
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:30,015
You knew?

452
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:31,767
Yes.

453
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:36,229
Before or after I stopped
you from shooting him?

454
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:37,606
Before.

455
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:39,024
And still you
tried to kill him!

456
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,692
He's a werewolf!
He's gonna kill people!

457
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:42,319
He can't help it!
It's not his fault!

458
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:43,904
I know, but he'll do it anyway!

459
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:46,281
Do you understand forgiveness?

460
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:48,909
Yes. I ask for it often.

461
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,372
They say Dracula has a cure.

462
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:55,374
If there's a chance
I can save my brother,

463
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:56,666
I'm going after it.
No.

464
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,751
I need to find Dracula.

465
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,586
And I need to find my brother!

466
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,338
He gave his life for me.

467
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:03,507
He's the only
family I have left.

468
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:08,011
I despise Dracula more
than you can ever imagine.

469
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:09,888
He has taken
everything from me,

470
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:12,432
leaving me alone in this world.

471
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:30,075
To have memories of those
you loved and lost

472
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:34,037
is perhaps harder than to
have no memories at all.

473
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:37,541
All right.

474
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:41,628
We'll look for your brother.

475
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:11,867
Igor.

476
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,368
Yes, Master.

477
00:49:13,452 --> 00:49:14,953
How long before we are ready?

478
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,038
Soon, Master. Very soon.

479
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:24,129
It is difficult without the good doctor
but the Dwergi, they are doing well?

480
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:25,297
NO!

481
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,966
Good.

482
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:32,721
For me, this is all personal.

483
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:34,723
It's all about
family and honor.

484
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,559
Why do you do it,
this job of yours?

485
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,102
What do you hope
to get out of it?

486
00:49:39,186 --> 00:49:42,022
I don't know.
Maybe some self-realization.

487
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:45,317
What have you got
out of it so far?

488
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,861
Nightmares.

489
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:53,033
Werewolves only shed
before the first full moon.

490
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:55,160
Before the curse has
completely consumed them.

491
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:07,672
What is this place?

492
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:09,591
Castle Frankenstein.

493
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,510
But it should be abandoned.

494
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:12,761
I don't understand.

495
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:15,263
The man who lived here
was killed a year ago.

496
00:50:15,347 --> 00:50:16,681
A grave robber,
among other things.

497
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:18,016
A year ago.

498
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,519
It was just after that that
your father went missing.

499
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:22,729
Yes. He was
looking for Dracula.

500
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,689
He was on his way to the sea.

501
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,859
I have never been to the sea.

502
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:35,200
I'll bet it's beautiful.

503
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:56,972
Werewolves are such a nuisance
during their first full moon.

504
00:50:58,139 --> 00:50:59,933
So hard to control.

505
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:25,792
I send you on a simple errand

506
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:28,336
to find out who
our new visitor is

507
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:32,424
and you have to stop for a
little chat with your sister.

508
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:34,509
Leave her out of this, Count.

509
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:36,553
She doesn't know your secret.

510
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:39,055
And I am soon to
take it to my grave.

511
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:41,766
Don't wish for
death so quickly.

512
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,768
I intend for you
to be quite useful.

513
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:45,604
I would rather
die than help you.

514
00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:46,855
Don't be boring.

515
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,773
Everyone who says that dies.

516
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,442
Besides, tonight,

517
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,444
after the final
stroke of midnight,

518
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:55,196
you will have no
choice but to obey me.

519
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:59,200
Look familiar?

520
00:52:03,705 --> 00:52:04,873
Father?

521
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,334
No!

522
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,877
He proved useless.

523
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,255
But I'm hoping, with werewolf
venom running through your veins

524
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:14,299
you will be of greater benefit!

525
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:22,349
I may have failed to kill you,
Count, but my sister will not.

526
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:31,191
Never!

527
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:49,793
Dwergi.

528
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:51,002
Dwergi?

529
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:52,587
Dracula's servants.

530
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:54,673
Industrious but
extremely vicious.

531
00:52:54,756 --> 00:52:57,676
If you get the chance to kill one, do
it because they'll do worse to you.

532
00:52:57,759 --> 00:52:59,094
Right.

533
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:07,394
They say they're using my brother
in some sort of experiment.

534
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:09,854
My brother is still battling
the sickness within him.

535
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:11,022
There's still hope.

536
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:12,148
Anna.

537
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:15,110
There is no hope
for your brother.

538
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:18,488
But we can still protect
others by killing Dracula.

539
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,455
Let us begin!

540
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:39,676
No slacking! Up!

541
00:53:54,566 --> 00:53:55,650
You ever
see these things before?

542
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:56,735
NO.

543
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:58,278
What do you think they are?

544
00:53:58,361 --> 00:53:59,529
Offspring.

545
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:00,613
What?

546
00:54:00,697 --> 00:54:02,699
A man with three
gorgeous women for 400 years.

547
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:05,535
Yes, vampires are
the walking dead.

548
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,996
It only makes sense their
children are born dead.

549
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,999
He's obviously trying
to bring them to life.

550
00:54:15,837 --> 00:54:17,338
Ladies first.

551
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:46,034
Dracula and his brides only
kill one or two people a month.

552
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:49,204
If he brings all these
things to life...

553
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:06,930
Throw the switches!

554
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:08,681
Yes, Master.

555
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:46,052
What are you doing?

556
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:47,762
I want to see what
we're up against.

557
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:21,588
So this is what you
get when vampires mate.

558
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:45,194
Come on!

559
00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:18,561
They need to feed.

560
00:57:18,645 --> 00:57:20,772
Teach them how. Teach them!

561
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:31,491
And beg the Devil

562
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:35,411
that this time they stay alive.

563
00:57:45,088 --> 00:57:46,172
This is where I come in.

564
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:47,465
No, wait!

565
00:57:58,226 --> 00:58:00,687
Now that I have your attention.

566
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,754
Yes, well, that's interesting.

567
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:38,808
That's not good.
Must warn somebody.

568
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:56,534
I can tell the character of a man
by the sound of his heartbeat.

569
00:58:57,618 --> 00:59:00,580
Usually when I approach

570
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:05,376
I can almost dance to the beat.

571
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:11,507
Strange that
yours is so steady.

572
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:21,684
Hurry up!

573
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:27,065
We must keep the
atmosphere electrified!

574
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:31,027
Accelerate the generators!

575
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,821
Power the dynamos!

576
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:36,824
We are losing power.

577
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:39,952
The human is insufficient.

578
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:46,793
Velkan.

579
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:01,432
Oh, my God.

580
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:36,968
Feed, my darlings! Feed!

581
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:00,700
May he rest in peace.

582
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:05,121
Hello, Gabriel.

583
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:06,933
We must not lose
the master's progeny!

584
01:02:10,061 --> 01:02:12,355
Is this your silver stake?

585
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:20,238
How long has it been?
300, 400 years?

586
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:27,662
You don't remember, do you?

587
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:31,040
Exactly what is it I
should be remembering?

588
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,834
You are the great Van Helsing.

589
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:39,006
Trained by monks and mullahs
from Tibet to Istanbul.

590
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:42,635
Protected by Rome herself.

591
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:46,764
But, like me,
hunted by all others.

592
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:49,267
The Knights of the Holy
Order know all about you.

593
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:51,102
It's no surprise you
would know about me.

594
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:53,479
Yes, but it's much
more than this.

595
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,655
We have such history,
you and I, Gabriel.

596
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:12,248
Have you ever wondered why you
have such horrible nightmares?

597
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:15,835
Horrific scenes of
ancient battles past.

598
01:03:20,298 --> 01:03:21,882
How do you know me?

599
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:31,183
Velkan.

600
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:32,727
Anna.

601
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,645
No. Don't unstrap me.

602
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:35,813
Don't unstrap me.

603
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,816
No, you must not! No! Stop!

604
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:40,443
Stop it.
I'm getting you out of here.

605
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:43,070
Velkan, it's all right.
I'm taking you home.

606
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:53,873
So would you like me to
refresh your memory a little?

607
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:57,793
A few details
from your sordid past.

608
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:11,098
Perhaps that is a conversation
for another time.

609
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:16,937
Allow me to reintroduce myself.

610
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:22,568
I am Count Vladislaus Dragulia.

611
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:27,031
Born 1422.

612
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:31,786
Murdered 1462.

613
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:46,967
Help me!

614
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:37,810
I think we've
overstayed our welcome.

615
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:25,566
Have you found the children?

616
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:26,942
Not yet.

617
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:32,323
What happened?

618
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:34,033
They just died.

619
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:40,748
How can I ever repay you?

620
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:50,841
But you can't do that.
You are a monk.

621
01:06:50,925 --> 01:06:53,260
Well,
actually I'm just a friar.

622
01:06:56,222 --> 01:06:59,558
I am sorry, master.
We try and we try,

623
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:04,188
but I fear we are not so smart as Dr.
Frankenstein.

624
01:07:04,939 --> 01:07:06,065
Truly.

625
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:11,278
It would appear the good doctor
took the key to life to his grave.

626
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:18,118
Hunt them down.

627
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,289
Kill them both.

628
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,753
A silver stake?
A crucifix?

629
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:30,714
What, did you think we haven't
tried everything before?

630
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:33,509
We've shot him,
stabbed him, clubbed him,

631
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:35,803
sprayed him with holy water,
staked him through the heart,

632
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:38,180
and still he lives!
Do you understand?

633
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:40,099
No one knows how
to kill Dracula.

634
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:43,811
Well, I could have used that
information a little earlier.

635
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:46,146
Don't give me that look.

636
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:53,445
You were right. I'm sorry.

637
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:56,407
He's not my brother anymore.

638
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:13,882
Do you have any family,
Mr. Van Helsing?

639
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:18,178
Not sure.
I hope to find out someday.

640
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:20,389
That's what keeps me going.

641
01:08:21,849 --> 01:08:23,309
Here's to what keeps you going.

642
01:08:23,392 --> 01:08:25,477
Absinthe. Strong stuff.

643
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:33,152
Don't let it touch your tongue.
it'll knock you on your...

644
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:54,506
Vampire.

645
01:08:57,843 --> 01:08:59,136
Vampires!

646
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:07,853
Now I remember.

647
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:24,161
"Even a man who is pure in heart
And says his prayers by night

648
01:09:24,912 --> 01:09:29,291
"May become a wolf
when the wolf bane blooms

649
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,294
"And the moon is shining bright

650
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,006
"Or crave another's blood
when the sun goes down

651
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:38,342
"And his body takes to flight"

652
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,467
There's something down here.

653
01:10:22,845 --> 01:10:24,722
And it's carnivorous.

654
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:31,103
Whatever it is,
it appears to be human.

655
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:39,987
I'd say he's a size 17.
Around 360 pounds.

656
01:10:40,821 --> 01:10:43,031
8.5 to 9 feet tall.

657
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:48,120
He has a bad gimp in his right
leg and three copper teeth.

658
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:50,164
How do you know
he has copper teeth?

659
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,833
Because he's standing
right behind you. Move!

660
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:01,550
On, my God!
The Frankenstein monster!

661
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:04,803
Monster?
Who's the monster here?

662
01:11:06,764 --> 01:11:12,060
I have done nothing wrong and yet
you and your kind all wish me dead!

663
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,209
What do you want?

664
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:38,712
To exist.

665
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:52,559
Don't!

666
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:54,186
We must kill it.
Wait.

667
01:11:54,269 --> 01:11:57,731
If you value your lives
and the lives of your kind,

668
01:11:58,273 --> 01:11:59,983
you will kill me.

669
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:01,276
No.

670
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:03,612
If Dracula finds me.

671
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:09,243
I am the key to
my father's machine.

672
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:12,079
The key to life.

673
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:15,791
Life for Dracula's children.

674
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:17,501
He already
awakened them last night.

675
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,044
Two.

676
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:22,297
And those were
from only one bride.

677
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:26,385
From one single birthing.

678
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:30,097
And they died as they did
the last time he tried.

679
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:38,188
Only with me can he
give them lasting life.

680
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:40,941
There are more?
More of those things?

681
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:43,443
Thousands.

682
01:12:44,945 --> 01:12:46,446
Thousands more.

683
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:02,087
No.
You heard what he said.

684
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:05,382
My life, my job is
to vanquish evil.

685
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:06,967
I can sense evil.

686
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,386
This thing, man, whatever it is

687
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:12,055
evil may have created it,
may have left its mark on it.

688
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:15,183
But evil does not rule
it, so I cannot kill it.

689
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,728
I can.
Not while I'm here.

690
01:13:23,692 --> 01:13:25,986
Your family has spent 400
years trying to kill Dracula.

691
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:29,156
Maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way.

692
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:40,959
Oh, my God. He's seen us.

693
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:43,170
Now they'll come for him.

694
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:45,172
Neither you nor I will
be able to stop them.

695
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:48,508
If I can get him to Rome,
we can protect him there.

696
01:13:48,592 --> 01:13:51,762
And then the painting came alive and
the two creatures attacked each other.

697
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:52,888
What does it mean?

698
01:13:52,971 --> 01:13:53,931
I don't know.

699
01:13:54,014 --> 01:13:56,683
Listen, Carl, whatever you
do, don't stare at him.

700
01:13:58,644 --> 01:14:00,771
I'm staring at him.

701
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:02,230
Is that a man?

702
01:14:02,314 --> 01:14:03,357
Actually, it's seven men.

703
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,441
Parts of them, anyway.

704
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:07,152
By exposing me,
you have condemned me!

705
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:09,029
Me and all of humanity!

706
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,698
Nothing is faster
than Transylvanian horses.

707
01:14:11,782 --> 01:14:13,533
Not even a werewolf.

708
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:16,203
Anything else,
you're on your own.

709
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,010
Let me go.

710
01:14:32,094 --> 01:14:33,512
Where are you going to go?

711
01:14:33,595 --> 01:14:37,057
I don't know if you've seen a mirror lately
but you kind of stick out in a crowd.

712
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:58,907
We must not let the
creature be destroyed!

713
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:08,333
Save him!
Save the monster!

714
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,272
Stakes!

715
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:42,409
No!

716
01:18:03,096 --> 01:18:04,472
Oh, my God.

717
01:18:12,189 --> 01:18:13,315
What are you doing out here?

718
01:18:13,315 --> 01:18:15,525
- Cam
- Right.

719
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:17,569
Don't let go!

720
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:31,958
I can help!

721
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:33,460
You won't kill me?

722
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:35,545
Only if you don't hurry!

723
01:19:58,753 --> 01:19:59,754
Velkan.

724
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:08,888
Anna.

725
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:17,731
Forgive me.

726
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:28,158
I will see you again.

727
01:20:39,419 --> 01:20:41,087
You killed him.

728
01:20:43,006 --> 01:20:45,633
Now you know why
they call me murderer.

729
01:20:53,892 --> 01:20:55,268
Oh, my God.

730
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,730
You've been bitten.

731
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:27,634
Anna.

732
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:54,494
So much trouble to my master.

733
01:21:54,661 --> 01:21:56,704
So much trouble.

734
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:58,540
What do you want?

735
01:21:58,623 --> 01:22:00,834
The master commands a trade.

736
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:06,923
The monster for the Princess.

737
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,843
Somewhere public.
Lots of people.

738
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:14,264
A place where your master
will be less inclined

739
01:22:14,347 --> 01:22:16,641
to expose his other side.

740
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:22,689
Tomorrow night is
All Hallows' Eve.

741
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:27,527
Here in Budapest, there is
a wonderful masquerade ball.

742
01:22:38,705 --> 01:22:40,248
Are you all right?
No.

743
01:22:43,835 --> 01:22:45,336
He has been bitten.

744
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:47,213
Bitten by a werewolf.

745
01:22:48,548 --> 01:22:52,427
Now you will become that which
you have hunted so passionately.

746
01:23:00,185 --> 01:23:01,561
I am sorry.

747
01:23:02,395 --> 01:23:06,024
May others be as passionate
in their hunting of you.

748
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:13,531
Well, they won't
find him in here.

749
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:15,492
I'm sure this is
some sort of sin.

750
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:16,951
Don't worry,
God will forgive us.

751
01:23:17,035 --> 01:23:18,328
We need to save Anna.

752
01:23:18,411 --> 01:23:19,954
You don't think
the hat's a bit much?

753
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:21,581
Carl, help me!
Right.

754
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:24,459
How many commandments
can we break in one day?

755
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:26,544
Anyway, according to the book

756
01:23:26,628 --> 01:23:30,006
you won't turn into a werewolf until
the rising of your first full moon.

757
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:31,674
That's two nights from now.

758
01:23:31,758 --> 01:23:34,260
Even then, you'll still be able
to fight Dracula's hold over you

759
01:23:34,344 --> 01:23:35,970
until the final
stroke of midnight.

760
01:23:36,054 --> 01:23:37,347
Sounds like I
have nothing to worry about.

761
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:39,224
My God,
you should be terrified.

762
01:23:39,307 --> 01:23:40,850
Thank you.
Sorry.

763
01:23:40,934 --> 01:23:44,103
We still have 48 hours
to find a solution.

764
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:45,522
You sure he can't
get out of there?

765
01:23:45,605 --> 01:23:48,066
Not without some
help from the dead.

766
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:16,863
How does it feel to be
a puppet on my string?

767
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:19,198
I won't let you
trade me, Count.

768
01:25:19,866 --> 01:25:22,368
I have no intention
of trading you.

769
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:25,496
And if I know Van Helsing,
which I do,

770
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:28,207
he is not planning on
making a trade, either.

771
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:32,420
Neither of us has
ever settled for half.

772
01:25:39,093 --> 01:25:40,553
There they are.

773
01:25:40,637 --> 01:25:42,555
You make my skin crawl.

774
01:25:43,598 --> 01:25:48,269
This is not all I
could do with your skin.

775
01:25:58,404 --> 01:26:00,740
Carl, I need you
to do something.

776
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:02,408
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

777
01:26:07,121 --> 01:26:09,415
Don't we make a lovely couple?

778
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:11,167
Oh, my God.

779
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,586
I am looking for
a new bride, Anna.

780
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:17,924
Someone strong and beautiful.

781
01:26:29,519 --> 01:26:31,771
One brief moment of pain,

782
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:35,608
and we can be together forever.

783
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:45,952
You have no heartbeat.

784
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:51,416
Perhaps it just needs

785
01:26:51,499 --> 01:26:53,292
to be rekindled.

786
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,319
Anna. Anna!

787
01:27:20,695 --> 01:27:21,946
Wake up.

788
01:27:22,447 --> 01:27:23,698
Gabriel.

789
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:27,994
Oh, Gabriel.

790
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:34,542
Oh, Gabriel.

791
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:40,298
Welcome to my summer palace.

792
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:45,136
Master! Look, Master!

793
01:27:46,763 --> 01:27:48,931
We have him, Master.

794
01:27:49,015 --> 01:27:50,516
We have him.

795
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:54,812
You wretched undead!

796
01:27:54,896 --> 01:27:57,190
I shall have my revenge!

797
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:01,110
"Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death

798
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:04,071
"l shall fear no evil."

799
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:07,283
You are nothing
but damned bones

800
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:09,410
and damned souls,

801
01:28:09,494 --> 01:28:13,873
and will burn in
the flames of Hell!

802
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:23,049
Now that everything
is as it should be,

803
01:28:24,717 --> 01:28:28,638
ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you,

804
01:28:30,223 --> 01:28:32,308
Van Helsing!

805
01:28:37,438 --> 01:28:38,689
Come on.

806
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,945
Yes!

807
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:52,411
Now I know what it's for.

808
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,330
Where are we going?

809
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:55,581
Through that window!

810
01:29:13,641 --> 01:29:15,601
Carl, you're a genius!

811
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:19,021
A genius with access
to unstable chemicals.

812
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:32,952
Say goodbye to your friends.

813
01:29:52,972 --> 01:29:55,892
I'll find you!
I'll get you back and set you free!

814
01:29:55,975 --> 01:29:57,518
I swear to God!

815
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:06,485
I must save him.

816
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:09,030
No, you can't.
Why?

817
01:30:09,113 --> 01:30:11,407
I cabled Rome earlier to
apprise them of our situation.

818
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,533
What did they say?

819
01:30:12,617 --> 01:30:13,826
Even if you
somehow kill Dracula,

820
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:17,246
Rome orders you to destroy
Frankenstein as well.

821
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:18,372
He isn't evil.

822
01:30:18,456 --> 01:30:20,249
But they say he
isn't human, either.

823
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:21,876
Do they know him?
Have they spoken to him?

824
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:23,002
Who are they to judge?

825
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:26,130
They want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity.

826
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:28,549
What of me?
Did you tell them what I'm to become?

827
01:30:28,633 --> 01:30:30,509
Did they tell
you how to kill me?

828
01:30:30,593 --> 01:30:33,262
The correct angle of the
stake as it enters my heart?

829
01:30:33,346 --> 01:30:35,681
The exact measure of
silver in each bullet?

830
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:37,683
Stop!

831
01:30:37,767 --> 01:30:38,893
No, I left you out!

832
01:30:57,495 --> 01:30:58,829
I'm sorry.

833
01:31:03,793 --> 01:31:05,252
It's starting.

834
01:31:19,934 --> 01:31:23,062
They must have taken all
the equipment to Dracula's lair.

835
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:25,398
Wherever that is.

836
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:32,238
Look, there's still time.

837
01:31:32,321 --> 01:31:34,949
Dracula can't bring his children
to life until the sun sets.

838
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:36,283
The sun sets in two hours.

839
01:31:36,367 --> 01:31:38,285
We've been looking for him
for more than 400 years!

840
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:42,039
Yes, well, I wasn't around for
those 400 years, now, was I?

841
01:31:43,374 --> 01:31:45,084
All right, Carl,
what have you learned?

842
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:48,504
That Count Dracula was actually
the son of Valerious the Elder.

843
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:49,964
The son of your ancestor.

844
01:31:50,047 --> 01:31:52,008
Everybody knows that.
What else?

845
01:31:52,091 --> 01:31:57,680
All right. Well, according to this rubbing
it all started when Dracula was murdered.

846
01:31:57,763 --> 01:31:59,056
Do you know who murdered him?
No,

847
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:02,018
there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

848
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:06,188
And in 1462, when Dracula died,

849
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,857
he made a covenant
with the Devil.

850
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:09,483
And was given a new life.

851
01:32:09,567 --> 01:32:12,445
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

852
01:32:12,528 --> 01:32:14,697
Excuse me. Are you going
to let me tell the story?

853
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:15,781
Sorry.

854
01:32:15,865 --> 01:32:18,784
And your ancestor, having
sired this evil creature,

855
01:32:18,868 --> 01:32:21,287
went to Rome to
seek forgiveness.

856
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:23,414
That's when the
bargain was made.

857
01:32:23,497 --> 01:32:24,665
He was to kill Dracula

858
01:32:24,749 --> 01:32:28,377
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family

859
01:32:28,461 --> 01:32:30,755
right down the line
all the way to you.

860
01:32:30,838 --> 01:32:32,548
But he couldn't do it.

861
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:35,217
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

862
01:32:35,301 --> 01:32:38,888
So he banished him
to an icy fortress

863
01:32:38,971 --> 01:32:41,390
sending him through a door from
which there was no return.

864
01:32:41,474 --> 01:32:42,475
And then the Devil
gave him wings.

865
01:32:42,558 --> 01:32:43,559
Yes.

866
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:45,144
All right,
so where is this door?

867
01:32:45,269 --> 01:32:46,812
I don't know.

868
01:32:48,022 --> 01:32:51,067
But when your ancestor couldn't
kill his son, he left clues.

869
01:32:53,027 --> 01:32:55,863
So that future generations
might do it for him.

870
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:58,115
That must be what my father
was looking for in here.

871
01:32:58,199 --> 01:33:00,326
Clues to the door's location.

872
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:01,744
The door.

873
01:33:04,371 --> 01:33:05,498
Of course.

874
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:08,709
You said your father spent hours
staring at this painting,

875
01:33:08,793 --> 01:33:09,919
trying to find the lair.

876
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:11,420
I think you were right.
Quite literally.

877
01:33:11,504 --> 01:33:15,341
I think this is the door.
He just didn't know how to open it.

878
01:33:15,424 --> 01:33:17,259
Look.
A Latin inscription.

879
01:33:17,343 --> 01:33:19,303
Maybe it works like that
painting in the tower.

880
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:22,723
If this were a door, my father
would have opened it long ago.

881
01:33:23,808 --> 01:33:27,353
I can't finish the inscription.
There's a piece missing.

882
01:33:33,317 --> 01:33:34,610
Your father didn't have this.

883
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:35,820
Where did you get that?

884
01:33:35,903 --> 01:33:37,530
Carl, finish it.

885
01:33:44,954 --> 01:33:47,748
In the name of God,
open this door.

886
01:34:00,052 --> 01:34:01,387
A mirror.

887
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:04,306
Dracula has no reflection
in the mirror.

888
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:05,641
But why?

889
01:34:08,269 --> 01:34:11,147
Maybe, to Dracula it's
not a mirror at all.

890
01:34:32,042 --> 01:34:35,796
It's cold.
And it's snowing.

891
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:42,970
See you on the other side.

892
01:34:46,098 --> 01:34:47,516
Be careful.

893
01:35:29,516 --> 01:35:31,101
Castle Dracula.

894
01:36:22,069 --> 01:36:23,404
Do we have a plan?

895
01:36:23,487 --> 01:36:25,322
It doesn't have to be
Wellington's at Waterloo,

896
01:36:25,406 --> 01:36:26,699
but some sort of
plan would be nice.

897
01:36:26,782 --> 01:36:28,117
We're going to go stop Dracula.

898
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,286
And kill anything
that gets in our way.

899
01:36:30,369 --> 01:36:32,705
Well, you let
me know how that goes.

900
01:36:44,091 --> 01:36:45,801
Well, as grateful as I am
to be out of the cold,

901
01:36:45,884 --> 01:36:48,429
that doesn't seem
like a good thing.

902
01:36:53,726 --> 01:36:55,644
We'd better get moving.

903
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:09,199
So are all of those...

904
01:37:09,283 --> 01:37:10,367
Yes.

905
01:37:10,451 --> 01:37:12,161
- And inside them are...
- Yes.

906
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:15,247
Igor do this!
Igor do that!

907
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:20,252
How did you find...
it's impossible!

908
01:37:25,257 --> 01:37:26,508
Please don't kill me!

909
01:37:26,592 --> 01:37:27,676
Why not?

910
01:37:28,886 --> 01:37:30,346
Well, I...

911
01:37:41,106 --> 01:37:43,317
My master has awakened.

912
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:05,839
There is a cure.

913
01:38:05,923 --> 01:38:07,216
What?

914
01:38:07,299 --> 01:38:11,470
Dracula. He has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf!

915
01:38:12,388 --> 01:38:16,809
Go, find the cure!
Save yourself!

916
01:38:28,112 --> 01:38:29,905
Come on. You heard him.
Let's find it.

917
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:31,782
Wait.
Why does Dracula have a cure?

918
01:38:31,865 --> 01:38:32,991
I don't care!

919
01:38:33,075 --> 01:38:34,284
I do.

920
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:37,329
Why does he need one?
Why?

921
01:38:37,996 --> 01:38:42,209
Because the only thing that
can kill him is a werewolf.

922
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:43,752
The painting.
That's what it meant.

923
01:38:43,836 --> 01:38:46,839
But Dracula's been using werewolves
to do his bidding for centuries.

924
01:38:46,922 --> 01:38:49,675
Yes, but if one ever had the will
to turn on him, he'd need a cure

925
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,970
to remove the curse and make
him human before it bit him.

926
01:38:54,888 --> 01:38:57,266
You're going to take these two
and lead them to the antidote.

927
01:38:57,349 --> 01:38:58,559
No, I'm not.

928
01:38:59,893 --> 01:39:01,270
Yes, I am.

929
01:39:02,104 --> 01:39:04,398
Here's the plan.
When the bell begins to toll midnight,

930
01:39:04,481 --> 01:39:05,774
you'll be able to kill Dracula.

931
01:39:05,858 --> 01:39:08,652
We just need to find the cure and get
it into you before the final stroke.

932
01:39:08,735 --> 01:39:10,779
Are you insane?
What kind of plan is that?

933
01:39:10,863 --> 01:39:14,074
If they even suspect
you of misleading them...

934
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:15,451
Clip off one of his fingers.

935
01:39:15,534 --> 01:39:16,535
I'll clip off something.

936
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:18,704
The tower over there,
that's where it is.

937
01:39:18,787 --> 01:39:20,289
And what about the other tower?

938
01:39:20,372 --> 01:39:21,665
Give me that!
That is where

939
01:39:21,748 --> 01:39:23,792
we reassembled the laboratory.

940
01:39:23,876 --> 01:39:25,377
Would I lie to you?

941
01:39:26,378 --> 01:39:27,838
Not if you wanted to live.

942
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:32,926
Now, if I'm not cured by the
twelfth stroke of midnight...

943
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:37,639
I don't think I could.

944
01:39:37,723 --> 01:39:39,057
You must.

945
01:39:44,855 --> 01:39:46,106
Come on.

946
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:49,651
I don't like this plan.

947
01:39:49,735 --> 01:39:50,986
We don't have a choice.

948
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:52,154
Just don't get killed.

949
01:39:52,237 --> 01:39:54,072
You still don't understand.

950
01:39:54,156 --> 01:39:56,492
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

951
01:39:56,575 --> 01:39:58,535
We must save my family.

952
01:39:58,952 --> 01:40:01,830
If you're late, run like hell.

953
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:07,628
Don't be late.

954
01:40:21,183 --> 01:40:23,727
Now go. Go.

955
01:40:49,419 --> 01:40:52,130
Get off me,
you vermin from hell!

956
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:59,388
What are you complaining about?
This is why you were made!

957
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:03,559
To prove that God is not the
only one who can create life!

958
01:41:04,268 --> 01:41:08,438
And now you must give
that life to my children.

959
01:41:08,939 --> 01:41:09,982
Up!

960
01:42:24,473 --> 01:42:26,058
There it is.

961
01:42:31,438 --> 01:42:33,065
I'll go first.

962
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:56,546
Carl!

963
01:42:59,216 --> 01:43:04,346
Stay as long as you like.
You try to get Igor. Igor get you!

964
01:43:47,347 --> 01:43:49,433
Go ahead. Grab it.

965
01:43:49,558 --> 01:43:51,643
You go ahead and grab it.

966
01:43:52,269 --> 01:43:54,688
If there's one thing I've learned
it's never to be the first to stick

967
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:56,815
your hand in
a viscous material.

968
01:44:03,822 --> 01:44:05,365
Did I scare you?

969
01:44:05,449 --> 01:44:06,908
No.

970
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:11,455
Then maybe I need to
try a little harder.

971
01:44:18,837 --> 01:44:21,590
Viscous material!
What did I tell you?

972
01:44:21,673 --> 01:44:23,341
Get it!

973
01:44:32,184 --> 01:44:34,352
Hot.

974
01:44:34,436 --> 01:44:35,437
Come on!
Yes.

975
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:39,024
We've got to get the
antidote to Van Helsing! Go!

976
01:44:42,194 --> 01:44:43,987
You can't go until
I say you can go!

977
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:45,697
Keep running, Carl!

978
01:44:46,907 --> 01:44:49,701
And I'll say you can
go when you're dead!

979
01:45:33,245 --> 01:45:34,746
Oh, my God!

980
01:46:04,901 --> 01:46:08,363
What are you doing?
You must find the cure!

981
01:46:08,446 --> 01:46:09,823
My friends are doing it for me.

982
01:46:09,906 --> 01:46:11,199
Friends.

983
01:46:11,283 --> 01:46:12,993
Yes. You want one?

984
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:14,369
I can't unscrew the bolts.

985
01:46:14,452 --> 01:46:15,745
This is gonna hurt.

986
01:46:15,829 --> 01:46:17,706
I am accustomed to pain.

987
01:46:17,789 --> 01:46:19,583
It lets you know you're alive.

988
01:46:37,601 --> 01:46:39,769
Give me life!

989
01:46:55,076 --> 01:46:58,830
One more bolt and
my young will live.

990
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:14,804
You're almost out, my friend!

991
01:49:32,317 --> 01:49:33,818
Help me!

992
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,488
But you're supposed to die.

993
01:49:37,155 --> 01:49:39,407
I want to live.

994
01:49:42,827 --> 01:49:44,162
Au right!

995
01:49:49,167 --> 01:49:51,252
Be happy in the knowledge

996
01:49:51,336 --> 01:49:55,298
that I shall weep
over your dead body.

997
01:49:59,469 --> 01:50:01,679
Hang on!

998
01:50:02,514 --> 01:50:04,849
I'll swing you loose!

999
01:50:38,967 --> 01:50:41,177
You are too late, my friend.

1000
01:50:42,428 --> 01:50:44,180
My children live.

1001
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:47,934
Then the only way to
kill them is to kill you.

1002
01:50:48,601 --> 01:50:49,727
Correct.

1003
01:50:52,564 --> 01:50:53,898
So be it.

1004
01:50:57,986 --> 01:50:59,070
One.

1005
01:51:05,034 --> 01:51:07,829
No, this cannot be.

1006
01:51:21,926 --> 01:51:25,471
We are both part of the
same grand game, Gabriel.

1007
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:29,809
But we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board.

1008
01:52:16,773 --> 01:52:21,152
Go!
Go and help Van Helsing!

1009
01:52:25,073 --> 01:52:26,407
Now!

1010
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:29,077
Thank you.

1011
01:52:56,062 --> 01:53:01,109
Oh, my God! Anna,
I need a little help!

1012
01:53:04,237 --> 01:53:05,446
Hurry!

1013
01:53:16,416 --> 01:53:18,584
Throw it to me, Carl!

1014
01:53:25,049 --> 01:53:26,050
Yes!

1015
01:53:47,447 --> 01:53:50,950
You are being used,
Gabriel, as was I.

1016
01:53:51,367 --> 01:53:54,037
But I escaped. So can you.

1017
01:54:36,871 --> 01:54:38,581
Anna, my love,

1018
01:54:38,664 --> 01:54:42,293
it is your blood that
shall keep me beautiful.

1019
01:54:43,002 --> 01:54:45,088
What do you think of that?

1020
01:54:49,425 --> 01:54:51,969
I think if you're going to
kill someone, kill them.

1021
01:54:52,053 --> 01:54:54,222
Don't stand there
talking about it.

1022
01:55:18,496 --> 01:55:22,959
Don't you understand?
We could be friends.

1023
01:55:23,334 --> 01:55:24,419
Partners!

1024
01:55:25,711 --> 01:55:27,380
Brothers-in-arms!

1025
01:55:58,077 --> 01:56:02,290
Did I mention that it
was you who murdered me?

1026
01:56:03,166 --> 01:56:10,047
It must be such a burden.
Such a curse to be the Left Hand of God.

1027
01:56:12,967 --> 01:56:15,595
All I want is life, Gabriel.

1028
01:56:16,429 --> 01:56:19,140
The continuation of my kind.

1029
01:56:19,223 --> 01:56:23,060
And perhaps
the return of my ring.

1030
01:56:27,106 --> 01:56:30,067
Don't be afraid, Gabriel.
Don't be afraid.

1031
01:56:31,444 --> 01:56:36,699
I shall give you back
your life, your memory.

1032
01:56:37,575 --> 01:56:39,827
Some things are
better left forgotten.

1033
01:57:13,402 --> 01:57:14,654
For God!

1034
01:57:23,788 --> 01:57:25,373
God forgive me.

1035
01:58:00,157 --> 01:58:01,534
She's dead.

1036
01:58:58,341 --> 01:59:00,092
"Eternal rest grant unto her,

1037
01:59:00,176 --> 01:59:01,594
"Oh, Lord,
and let perpetual light

1038
01:59:01,677 --> 01:59:04,096
”shine upon her.
On her soul and the souls of all

1039
01:59:11,937 --> 01:59:13,731
”On her soul and
the souls of all

1040
01:59:13,814 --> 01:59:17,401
"the dead
faithful have mercy.”

1041
02:01:37,356 --> 02:02:01,345
